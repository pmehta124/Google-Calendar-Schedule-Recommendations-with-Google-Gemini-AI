## Inspiration
Our inspiration for Break Balance stemmed from the growing amounts of stress and mental health pressures in recent years. As college students balancing classes, clubs, part-time jobs, and internships, we know the importance of scheduling personal time into our daily schedules. And working full-time is a whole different story! Our team wanted to create a solution that leverages AI to promote well-being by incorporating breaks and mood-boosting elements into employees’ work routines. Our goal was to create a website where employees can automatically insert well-being activities into their calendars using AI, based on when they like to wake up/sleep, their preferences, their mood today, and what the weather is today. In addition, we wanted to add song or meme suggestions based on the user’s mood. While we were not able to implement the entirety of this vision, we attempted to implement the core of the product. 

## What It Does
First, Break Balance connects to a user’s Google calendar using the Google Calendar API. Then, the website extracts the events the user has for the day, which are then connected with the Google Gemini API. We then instruct Gemini to create a specific, personalized schedule that will add breaks, lunch or dinner times, and other mental well-being suggestions. We then extract the new events and use the Calendar API again to write the new events into the employee’s Calendar automatically.
